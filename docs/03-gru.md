### gru.iobio

Gru.iobio is the api powering the iobio client apps.

### Local development

The endpoints are not likely to change, so gru does not use nodemon to hot reload during local development. Any changes to the endpoints require a server restart.

### Data volume

Gru uses a SQLite in-memory database backed by a data volume.

See the full setup instructions here: `link to docs`
